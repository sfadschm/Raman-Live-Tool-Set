This is a LabView 2010 project for displaying and evaluating spectral data from mapping applications (e.g., Raman or luminescence). 

The project is located at [GitHub](https://github.com/sfadschm/Raman-Toolset-2.0).

Please take note of recent changes in the [*Changelog*](https://github.com/sfadschm/Raman-Toolset-2.0/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md) before switching to a new version.

## Credits
This project is derived from the famous `Raman Tool Set` library by Patrizio Candeloro ([**Analyst 138**, 7331, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1039/C3AN01665J)).

The original software can be found at [SourceForge](http://ramantoolset.sourceforge.net).

The functionality of the `Raman Toolset 2.0` is largely reduced compared to the original software and does not include its various data processing and manipulating routines.

Instead, some convenience procedures have been implemented to ease viewing live data.

## Functionality
`XY-WI` data can be read from a tab-separated file or from a live data feed.

The 4D data are evaluated by a chosen spectroscopic method and displayed as an interactive color-coded intensity map.

Single spectra can be selected for display from the map via mouse or keyboard navigation.

## Usage
Please refer to the [*User Guide*](https://github.com/sfadschm/Raman-Toolset-2.0/blob/develop/docs/build) or the [*Wiki*](https://github.com/sfadschm/Raman-Toolset-2.0/wiki) for an overview of data import, available evaluation methods and handling.
